### Introduction

Open research – which includes sharing code, data, and manuscripts – benefits the researchers who engage in open practices [@doi:10.7554/eLife.16800], their scientific peers, and the public.
`TODO: more references needed`
Here we describe the benefits of writing review articles openly, where the planning, organizing, writing, and editing occur collaboratively in a public forum where participants are free to join as they wish.
Reviews presenting the state of the art in a scientific field are often prepared by a single research group or a small team of colleagues.
In contrast, broadly opening the writing process to anyone engaged in the topic can help maximize the review's value by facilitating the representation of diverse opinions and the broad coverage of relevant research.
Review authors can engage with the authors of original research to clarify their methods and results and present them accurately (for example, [@url:https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/issues/213]).
`TODO: need archival issue link`
In addition, discussing manuscripts in the open provides one form of pre- and post-publication peer review `TODO: define this or provide a reference?`, incentivizing the reviews with potential manuscript authorship.
However, inviting wide authorship brings many technical and social challenges such as how to fairly distribute credit, coordinate the scientific content, and collaboratively manage extensive reference lists.

We present potential solutions to these challenges based on our recent experience leading a collaborative review "Opportunities And Obstacles For Deep Learning In Biology And Medicine" [@doi:10.1101/142760].
Our review attracted 27 authors from 20 different institutions who were not determined in advance.
`TODO: confirm institution count`
We wrote entirely in the open without restrictions on who was welcome to contribute.
Although we requested that some authors participate for their specific expertise, most discovered the manuscript organically through conferences or social media and independently decided to contribute.
`TODO: confirm "most"`
To coordinate this effort, we developed a manuscript writing process using the Markdown language, the GitHub software development platform [@url:https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review/], and our new Manubot tool [@url:https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock @url:https://github.com/greenelab/manubot] for automating manuscript generation.


### Collaborative writing and reviewing

There are many existing collaborative writing platforms ranging from rich text editors, which support Microsoft Word documents or similar formats, to LaTeX-based systems for more technical writing [@url:https://www.overleaf.com/ @url:https://www.authorea.com/].
`TODO: survey other existing options, see if there are better references`
These platforms typically offer version control and other features to support multi-author editing.
`TODO: some use git in the back end, is that relevant?`
However, their critical limitation for open writing is that they give all authors permission to modify all parts of the manuscript.
This makes it difficult to maintain consistent content and tone and is susceptible to malicious edits.
`TODO: are wikis, especially Wikipedia, relevant as an alternative approach?`

We adopted standard software development strategies in order to enable any contributor to edit any part of the manuscript but enforce discussion and review of all proposed changes.
The GitHub platform provided support for organizing and editing the manuscript.
We used GitHub _issues_ for organization, opening a new issue for each paper under consideration.
Within the issue, contributors summarized the research, discussed it (sometimes with the original authors), and assessed its relevance to the review.
Issues also served as an open to-do list and a forum for debating the main message, themes, and topics of the review.

GitHub and the underlying git version control system also structured the writing process.
An official master version could be _forked_ by individual contributors.
A contributor could then add and revise any files, grouping these changes into _commits_.
When the changes were ready to be reviewed, the series of commits could be submitted as a _pull request_ through GitHub, which notified other authors of the pending changes.
GitHub's review interface allows anyone to comment on the changes, globally or at specific lines, asking questions or requesting modifications from the author as depicted in [@url:https://medium.com/towards-data-science/opportunities-and-obstacles-for-deep-learning-in-biology-and-medicine-6ec914fe18c2].
Once all requested modifications were made, the manuscript maintainers, a subset of authors with elevated GitHub permissions, could formally approve the pull request and merge the changes into the official master version.
`TODO: need a figure with a flowchart showing this process`
The entire process can be orchestrated through GitHub with a web browser if a contributor does not want to use a git client on their own computer.
We found that this workflow was an effective compromise between fully unrestricted editing and a more heavily-structured approach that limits the authors or the sections they can edit.
In addition, authors are associated with their commits, which makes it easy for contributors to receive credit for their work and prevents ghostwriting [@doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1000023].

### Authorship

To determine authorship we followed the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines and used GitHub to track contributions.
ICMJE recommends authors substantially contribute to, draft, approve, and agree to be accountable for the manuscript [@url:http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html].
We acknowledged other contributors who did not meet all four criteria, including contributors who provided text but did not review and approve the complete manuscript.
`TODO: In Discussion, mention the challenge of determining contributions of potential authors who worked with someone else on the text but did not make their own commits`
Although these criteria provided a straightforward, equitable way to determine who would be an author, they did not produce a traditionally ordered author list.
In biomedical journals, the convention is that the first and last authors made the most substantial contributions to the manuscript.
This convention can be difficult to reconcile in a collaborative effort.
Using git, we could quantify the number of commits each author made or the number of sentences an author wrote or edited, but these metrics discount intellectual contributions such as discussing primary literature and reviewing pull requests.
However, there is no objective system to compare and weight the different types of contributions and produce an ordered author list.

To address this issue, we generalized the concept of "co-first" authorship, in which two or more authors are denoted as making equal contributions to a paper.
We defined four types of contributions [@doi:10.1101/142760], from major to minor, and reviewed the GitHub discussions and commits to assign authors to these categories.
A randomized algorithm then arbitrarily ordered authors within each contribution category, and we combined the category-specific author lists to produce a traditional ordering.
The randomization procedure was shared with the authors in advance (pre-registered) and run in a deterministic manner.
Given the same author contributions, it always produced the same ordered author list.
We annotated the author list to indicate that author order was partly randomized and emphasize that the order did not indicate one author contributed more than another from the same category.
`TODO: In Discussion, present alternative author ordering strategies and literature on contribution in collaborative projects`
