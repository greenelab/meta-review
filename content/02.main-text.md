### Introduction

Open research – which includes sharing code, data, and manuscripts – benefits the researchers who engage in open practices [@doi:10.7554/eLife.16800], their scientific peers, and the public.
`TODO: more references and context needed`
Here we advocate for the benefits of open review articles, specifically planning, organizing, writing, and editing this type of scientific manuscript collaboratively in an open forum.
Reviews presenting the state of the art in a scientific field are often prepared by a single research group or a small team of colleagues.
In contrast, broadly opening the writing process to anyone engaged in the topic can help maximize the review's value by ensuring that it represents diverse opinions and does not neglect relevant research.
Review authors can engage with authors of original research to clarify their methods and results and present them accurately.
In addition, discussing manuscripts in the open provides a form of pre- and post-publication peer review `TODO: define this or provide a reference?` and incentivizes it with the potential outcome of review manuscript authorship.
However, inviting wide authorship brings many technical and social challenges such as how to coordinate the scientific content, fairly distribute credit, and collaboratively manage extensive reference lists.
`TODO: elaborate on challenges`

We present potential solutions to these challenges based on our recent experience leading a collaborative review "Opportunities And Obstacles For Deep Learning In Biology And Medicine" [@doi:10.1101/142760].
`TODO: and the SciHub manuscript, or focus on reviews?`
`TODO: the remainder of the introduction will highlight the main features of the deep review and its authorship process as well as the manubot system`
