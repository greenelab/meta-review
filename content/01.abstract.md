## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Scientific literature reviews are ideal for open, collaborative writing.
Allowing any interested individual to contribute as an author can strengthen a review, providing broad and fair coverage of the subject matter.
However, the traditional multi-author writing process breaks down at scale.
We present techniques for overcoming the challenges of open manuscript writing.
These include our new software for automating citation and manuscript building as well as approaches for managing distributed authors.
