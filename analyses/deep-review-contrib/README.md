# Deep Review contribution stats & visualization

The notebooks in this directory rely on the `contrib-viz` conda environment, which can be installed using:

```sh
conda env create --file environment.yml

# install R dependencies not on conda-forge
source activate contrib-viz
Rscript install-manual-r-dependencies.r
```

The environment was updated to be compatible with Binder after the notebooks were originally run.
